00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:08.485
Essential oils are the heart of this program.

2
00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:10.965
It's their special characteristics

3
00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:12.685
and unique abilities combined

4
00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.525
with our emotional healing techniques that make this program

5
00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:18.445
one of a kind and immensely effective

6
00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.285
Oils are the secret ingredient

7
00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:24.325
that exponentially enhance all emotional healing.

8
00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:27.285
They facilitate change that is measurable.

9
00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.685
Scientific studies are proving

10
00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.685
and reproving their efficacy for body and mind.

11
00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:35.845
Do you remember how you just learned about the

12
00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:36.885
vibration of emotions?

13
00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:40.845
Well, an essential oil also carries the frequency

14
00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:42.085
and vibration of the plant.

15
00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:44.165
It came from applying

16
00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:47.285
and inhaling the essential oil will shift your emotional

17
00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:49.165
vibration almost instantly.

18
00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.165
That is why we recommend using the oils while you are in

19
00:00:52.165 --> 00:00:53.205
the middle of a big emotion.

20
00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.525
But they can go even further than this

21
00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:58.805
while they don't do the work for you.

22
00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:00.765
The oils can also bring pain

23
00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:02.725
and hurt that is longing to be healed

24
00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:04.765
to the surface for transformation.

25
00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:08.565
They strengthen you during each stage of the healing process

26
00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.125
and prepare you for the next level of healing.

27
00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:12.685
So here's an overview

28
00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:16.125
of the multifaceted ways essential oils facilitate

29
00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:18.965
breakthroughs on each level of our existence.

30
00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:22.325
Essential oils assist in healing the physical body,

31
00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:26.925
healing the heart, releasing limiting beliefs,

32
00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:30.165
increasing spiritual awareness and connection,

33
00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:34.085
and inspiring the fulfillment of our life's purpose.

34
00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.965
These concepts are covered in detail in the

35
00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:39.045
Essential Emotions Book.

36
00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.405
So for now, I will simply state here

37
00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.285
that essential oils are one of the most

38
00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:46.845
powerful catalyzing agents available on Earth.

39
00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.605
I can't wait for you to see what they can do for you

40
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:51.325
and those you work with.

41
00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.685
Now, each essential oil has its own distinctive purpose,

42
00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:58.365
and just as different plants offer varied physical healing

43
00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:02.085
benefits, they also offer varied emotional healing benefits.

44
00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:05.525
The primary emotional purpose of each essential oil

45
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:10.045
for our era is contained in the Essential Emotions Book.

46
00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:12.885
You'll be partnering with these oil descriptions

47
00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:13.885
during the coaching process

48
00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:16.125
so the plants can work with your clients.

49
00:02:16.495 --> 00:02:19.965
One-on-One, it's my belief that plants are sentient

50
00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.525
and possess wisdom that they choose to impart

51
00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:25.205
for the healing of mankind.

52
00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:29.925
Our relationship with them is symbiotic and ancient,

53
00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:33.045
and they work with us through both their chemical

54
00:02:33.045 --> 00:02:35.885
constituents and their energetic life force.

55
00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:40.405
They are quickening agents, teachers, allies.

56
00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:45.045
The plans have taught me in their special way the messages

57
00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:46.445
that they want shared with the world,

58
00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:48.725
and they will teach you too.

59
00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:52.725
Partnering with these plants with their oily life essence

60
00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:56.285
activates healing on every aspect of a person's being.

61
00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:59.725
I have witnessed firsthand their ability

62
00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:02.245
to reach the very soul of people.

63
00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:05.365
Our emotions are our teachers.

64
00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:08.605
The essential oils will be our guides.
